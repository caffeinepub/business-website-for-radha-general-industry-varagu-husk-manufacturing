# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new “Machinery” showcase within the existing Process section to highlight key husk-processing machines with improved, token-based colors while keeping the page background pure white.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a “Machinery” content block inside the existing Process section (no new route) with at least 3 items (dehusking/husk machine, separator/cleaner, packing machine), each with an English title and 1–2 sentence description.
- Implement a responsive layout for the Machinery block (single column on mobile, multi-column grid on larger screens).
- Apply “good color” styling using existing design tokens (primary/accent/card/border) for clear hierarchy within cards while preserving a pure white page background (no tinted/gray full-bleed section backgrounds or gradients).
- Add and reference static machinery visuals from `frontend/public/assets/generated`, including appropriate English alt text.

**User-visible outcome:** The Process section now includes a clearly labeled, visually polished Machinery block showing three husk-processing machines with images, titles, and short descriptions that display well on both mobile and desktop.
