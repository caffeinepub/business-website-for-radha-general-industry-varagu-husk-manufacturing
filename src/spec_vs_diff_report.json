  "summary": "REQ-1 (replace orange background with plain white globally) appears implemented by setting the light-mode background token to pure white and explicitly forcing html/body/#root backgrounds to white. However, the diff also includes broader theme/palette changes and project metadata updates that were not requested.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to replace the orange background with plain white and ensure bg-background + base page backgrounds render white. It does not request a full theme/palette overhaul.",
