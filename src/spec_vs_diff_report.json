  "summary": "REQ-1 and most of REQ-2 appear implemented by adding a new MachineryBlock component and composing it into the existing Process section with a responsive grid and token-based styling on a white section background. REQ-3 cannot be verified because the diff summary does not show the required image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "requirement": "Generate and add static machinery illustrations/photos under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them directly from the Machinery block with English alt text.",
      "reason": "The MachineryBlock references three image paths under /assets/generated, but the diff summary does not include any added image files in frontend/public/assets/generated (only a TSX component and a ProcessSection composition change are shown). Therefore, adding the required static assets cannot be confirmed and may cause missing-asset errors.",
