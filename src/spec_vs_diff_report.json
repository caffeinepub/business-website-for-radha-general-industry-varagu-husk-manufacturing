  "summary": "Diff largely implements fixed DA = 8419 in both Manual Entry and Tamil Nadu Hotel Rule modes, including UI messaging that DA is fixed and removal of DA-percentage configuration. However, the changes also appear to make Gross Salary fixed/immutable at 8419, which was not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Gross Salary is enforced as a fixed/immutable value of 8419 across zones/modes (not requested; request only fixed DA).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only requires DA to be fixed at 8419. Diff introduces constants and state initialization that fix gross salary to 8419 and sets gross salary in auto-calculation effects, implying gross salary can no longer vary.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useSalarySplit.ts (\"// Fixed gross salary - immutable across all zones and modes\" and FIXED_GROSS_SALARY = '8419'; createDefaultZoneState sets grossSalary to FIXED_GROSS_SALARY; effects set grossSalary: FIXED_GROSS_SALARY)",
        "frontend/src/components/salary/TamilNaduHotelRuleConfig.tsx (defines FIXED_GROSS = 8419 and uses it to compute amounts/percentages)",
